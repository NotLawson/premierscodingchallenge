# Quickstart
To run this app, there is a Docker Container that you can use.

    docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/notlawson/premierscodingchallenge:latest

Or, if you want to run in a debug environment (or just don't want to use docker), you need to run

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 main.py

# Hosted
There is a version already online, which is maintained by Lawson.
