## Ideas

### Notes/Study tools

The main topic I was leaning towards was study tools. I made some notes [here.](https://notlawson.notion.site/Ideas-9561d868620042ae8f3221c8a5e14802?pvs=4)

It would be a website that took your notes in Markdown. Sort of similar to [Notion](https://notion.so), but just the note taking side. 

- You would organise notes into folders, not databases like Notion.
- More tailored to students (timetable, assesment calendar, grade tracking) *side note: ohh, grade tracking, nice!*
- Stricter colaboration guard rails to prevent cheating or stealing work *e.g. if you invite someone to work on a page, they can only access subpages and not the entire notebook*
- Teachers would be able to share and asign homework from notes
- The app could also get information from a Wikipedia page

With the notes, you could link a sort of kahoot-like quiz to them (hence study tools).

- Very similar to games like [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it), [Gimkit](https://gimkit.com) and [Quizlet](https://quizlet.live)
- Flashcards?
- More focused on student led or solo games instead of whole class *e.g. solo study, or revision with friends
- Which links into another idea, a Discord Bot, that I'll discuss more on later

Since it's tailored to students (kids 10-16ish idk), it should be kinda gamified.

- Earn points for completing quiz sets or revision
- Leaderboard against friends, class, etc
- Use points to get cosmetics for the app?

Another extra I thought of was a Discord Bot for student led study servers.

- It could have a running leaderboard
- Join VCs and use the camera feature to display timers, notes, even quizzes
- !!! Use the new activites feature for interactive things !!!

Problems:

- Being student led, students can create thier own quiz sets. This could lead to some students creating extremely easy sets and cheating points -> in app cosmetics
- Might be way beyond my skill level? (come to think of it, it probably is :D)
